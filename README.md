##How to set up the game and run it

###On the web
You can find the game [here](http://lhellborg.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)

###Installation
Or if you would rather have it on your machine you can download it from my repo
- Go to my repo on [gitHub](https://github.com/lhellborg/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)
- Download the files by clicking the button `Download ZIP`
- Unzip it to your preferred destination on your computer
- click on the `index.html` file  to open in a web browser or go to your web browser and in the menu choose `File` and then `Open File`

- 5 small images should appear on the screen in the browser with a text saying **Choose a player by clicking on an image**

##How to play

###Choose a character
You have to choose a character by clicking on one of the images that appear on the screen.
###Move the character
When you have chosen a character the screenplay will appear and you can move your player by pressing the _up_, _down_, _left_ and _right_ arrow keys. The player will move accordingly one square at a time.
###How to get points and extra lives
You will get points by either **reaching the water** on the other side of the pavement or **collecting the nonmovable gems and other things** that appear on the screen. **The heart will give you extra lives**, one for each time you take it, There will only be two chances to get extra lives.
###Avoid
You have to **avoid the moving bugs**. Everytime you collide with one, one life will be taken from you and you have to restart from the original place on the screen. **Be extra careful in the lane to the left** since the bugs will come back to the screen when they leave it on the right. Sometimes it seems that you die in the left lane without any bug hitting you, but it is just coming into the screen and you are in his way!

Have Fun!
